What is HTML? HTML5?
====================

**HTML** is the markup language that defines the structure of your web page. 
If a web page were a house, HTML tags would be the 2x4s you assemble into the 
house's frame. All the content on your page lives inside little "boxes" defined 
by *HTML elements* (more on boxes and elements below).

***Semantic* HTML** refers, broadly, to HTML written in a way that is 
expressive—that in some way **describes its content**—and, narrowly, to a 
standardized set of semantic tags introduced with HTML5.

It's standard practice to, as much as possible, name CSS `class`es and `id`s so 
that they describe the **role** of the content within the HTML element they're 
attached to. For example:

Semantic HTML, illustrated
---------------------------

### Unsemantic:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="right-aligned">
  <div class="bold">Smurf Movie Kinda Sucks</div>
  <div class="body-text">
    Not surprisingly, this week's release of
    <span class="darkbold">The Smurfs</span> kinda sucks.
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

The above describes the formatting of each element's content, not its role. 
Among other problems, this isn't future-proof. What if, in the future, you want 
inline movie titles to be italicized rather than bolded? 

### Bad Semantics:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="article">
  <div class="article-title">Smurf Movie Kinda Sucks</div>
  <div class="article-content">
    Not surprisingly, this week's release of
    <span class="movie-title">The Smurfs</span> kinda sucks.
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

This is semantic, but not preferred. HTML5 introduced tags that communicate the 
above more succinctly.

### Good Semantics:

{% highlight html %}
<article>
  <h1>Smurf Movie Kinda Sucks</h1>
  <p>
    Not surprisingly, this week's release of
    <span class="movie-title">The Smurfs</span> kinda sucks.
  </p>
</article>
{% endhighlight %}

<small>
    Example borrowed from 
    <a style="text-decoration: underline;" 
        href="http://css-tricks.com/semantic-class-names">here</a>
    —apologies to any *Smurfs* fans out there. 
</small>

Ahh. So much easier on the eyes, right? Notice that this uses the semantic 
`article` tag, which was introduced with HTML5. Prefer HTML5 tags wherever 
possible—they'll keep your code expressive while minimizing visual noise.

Notice too that there are still cases where you'll have to use the unsemantic 
tags `<div>` and `<span>` semantically, with the aid of a well-named `class` or 
`id`.


Semantic Tags
-------------

`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<figure>`, 
`<figcaption>`, `<footer>`, `<details>`, `<summary>`, `<mark>`, `<time>` 

For some examples of use cases for each of these, see [HTML5 Semantic Elements 
(w3schools)][w3semantic].

What is CSS?
============

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to add styling to your page. 
Separating structure from style helps keep your markup clean and maintainable. 

It also means the same underlying HTML can be presented in radically different 
ways just by swapping its stylesheet (check out [CSS Zen Garden][css-zen] to 
see this beautifully illustrated).

[css-zen]:http://www.csszengarden.com

Basic Selectors
----------------

### 1. The tag itself
{% highlight css %}
 nav { ... }
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
 <nav> ... </nav>
{% endhighlight %}

### 2. `id` selector (any id selector can only be used once)
{% highlight css %}
 #navigation { ... }
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
 <div id="navigation"> ... </div>
{% endhighlight %}

### 3. `class` selectors (can be used multiple times)
{% highlight css %}
 .box { ... }
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
 <div class="box"> ... </div>
{% endhighlight %}


`class` vs. `id`
----------------

CSS classes and ids are just groupings of CSS rules. CSS classes are meant to 
be used any number of times, but ids are unique—there can be only one id of a 
given name on a page.

#### Example:

The following HTML 

{% highlight html %}
<!-- index.html -->
<body>
    <p id="introduction" class="emphasized">
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod.
    </p>
    <p class="emphasized">
        Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi.
    </p>
    <p>
        Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum.
    </p>
</body>
{% endhighlight %}

can be styled with CSS as follows:

{% highlight css %}
 /* stylesheet.css */
 body { font-weight: normal; }     /* by tag */
 #intro { font-style: italic }     /* by id */
 .emphasis { font-weight: bold; }  /* by class */
{% endhighlight %}


Interlude: Some nomenclature
----------------------------

We've been throwing around *elements* and *attributes* and *rules* without really
defining what we're talking about. Let's consolidate some of this terminology by 
way of an illustration:

### Anatomy of an HTML element

{% highlight html %}
<h1>Section Title</h1>
<a href="http://google.com" class="light">A link to Google</a>
<img id="author-photo" src="img/author.jpg">
{% endhighlight %}

| HTML       |  Example                                           |      
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------------- |     
| element    | `<h1>Section Title</h1>`                           |       
| tag        | opening: `<h1>`, `<a>`; closing: `</h1>`,`</a>`    |       
| attribute  | `href` and `class` in `<a href="..." class="...">` |         


### Anatomy of a CSS rule

{% highlight css %}
h1 { color: blue; font-size: 18px; }
.light { font-weight: 300; }
 #author-photo { width: 80%; }
{% endhighlight %}

| CSS        |  Example                                              |  
| :--------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | 
| rule       | `h1 { color: blue; font-size: 18px; }`                |   
| selector   | `h1`, &nbsp; `.light`,&nbsp; `#author-photo`          |     
| property   | `color` in `color: blue`                              |   
| value      | `blue` in `color: blue`                               |    


`div` vs. `span`
-----------------

The HTML tags `<div>` and `<span>` are generic tags used to group elements together 
and, with a CSS `class` and/or `id`, to add styling to particular elements on the 
page. 

The key distinction between the two is that a `<span>` is an inline element and a 
`<div>` is a block element. What does that mean?


Inline vs. Block elements
--------------------------

Block level elements normally start (and end) with a new line when displayed 
in a browser. Inline elements are normally displayed without starting a new line.

Example block elements: `<div>`,`<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<table>`<br>
Example inline elements: `<span>`,`<b>`, `<td>`, `<a>`, `<img>`

Note that this is the *default* behavior. You can manipulate how an element is 
displayed on the page by setting `display: block`, `display: inline`, or 
[`display: inline-block`][inlineblock], among other possibilities. 

[inlineblock]: http://robertnyman.com/2010/02/24/css-display-inline-block-why-it-rocks-and-why-it-sucks/     


The Box Model
--------------

Every element of a web page exists within an invisible box. This box is 
demarcated by a border. That border can be invisible (if it has `border-width` 
0, for example), but it's always there.

![box_model_from_chrome_devtools]({{ site.url }}/images/box_model.png)

### Margin and Padding

Every box has **padding** on the inside, surrounding its content but within its 
border, and a **margin** surrounding its border on the outside. 

Since `padding` tells the browser the amount of space to preserve *inside* a 
box (between content and border), the padding between any two elements is, 
loosely speaking, "additive": 10px of padding on two adjacent boxes will result 
in 20px of space between their content (assuming no visible border or margin). 

By contrast, `margin` specifies the amount of space to preserve *around* a box, 
which will usually be collapsed between two adjacent elements of the same 
type. A 10px margin on adjacent boxes produces a 10px space between their 
borders, not 20px.


Chrome Developer Tools
======================

To access Chrome's Developer Tools, navigate to `View > Developer > Developer Tools` 
or use the keyboard shortcut: <kbd>⌥</kbd>+<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> on a Mac, 
<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> otherwise. 

(NB: Try out and use keyboard shortcuts greedily. They will make your life easier 
in the long run.)

### Some of the facilities provided by DevTools:

* Inspect Element<br>
  Inspect the HTML, CSS, and box model for a given element (click the magnifying 
  glass and hover over a page element). DevTools brings up the relevant HTML, 
  the associated styling, a box model visualization with element dimensions, all 
  sorts of valuable information.
  
* Modify CSS In-Place<br>
  Select a page element. In the "Styles pane", fiddle with its CSS. Add 
  `display: none` to some elements. Pretty neat, huh?
  
  ![modifycss]({{ site.url }}/images/editcss.png)
  
* Modify HTML In-Place<br>
  Similarly, in Inspect Element mode, click on part of a web page. You should 
  see the corresponding HTML highlighted in the DevTools Elements panel. 
  Double-click on it and fiddle with it. 
  
  ![modifyhtml]({{ site.url }}/images/edithtml.png)
  
You can have all sorts of fun with this. 

To wit, here's the MDN landing page as it exists by default:

![mdn_before]({{ site.url }}/images/before.png)

and here it is after some enhancements

![mdn_after]({{ site.url }}/images/after.png)

In other words, Chrome Developer Tools are extremely useful for interactively 
testing out potential styling changes or checking out "how they did that" when 
you see some cool bit of styling on someone else's site.

### Mobile Testing

Want to see how your web site will look on a mobile device? Hit <kbd>esc</kbd> 
(the 'escape' key) to bring up the console, then click on "Emulation".

Resources
=========

[w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com) has a lingering bad reputation earned 
during its error-ridden early days, but it's not bad for getting a 
quick-and-dirty overview of whatever you're researching. 

[MDN](http://developer.mozilla.org) is the de facto canonical reference. When 
someone tells you to RTFM ("Read the Fantastic Manual") with respect to HTML/CSS,
they're most likely referring to the MDN docs. It is detailed and exhaustive, 
so the best way to find anything in it is with a google search: 
`mdn css font-weight`, for example, or by using Chrome's find (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+`f`) 
feature on the [HTML Element][elements], [HTML Attribute][attrs], or 
[CSS][cssref] reference page.

[attrs]: http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes
