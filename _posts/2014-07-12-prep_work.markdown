<!-- Setting up Terminal (Macs)


Copy and paste the following into Terminal:

{% highlight text %}
ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" ~/usr/local/bin/subl
echo "export EDITOR='subl -w'" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
{% endhighlight %}

The first line will allow you to open Sublime Text from the command line by issuing `subl`. The second will make ST your default command-line text editor. -->
