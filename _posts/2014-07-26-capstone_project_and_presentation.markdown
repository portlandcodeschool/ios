Goals
=====
1. Understand the differences between a pitch presentation and a code walkthrough
2. Understand Guy Kawasaki's 10-20-30 rule
3. Establish teams and determine responsibilities for team members
4. Start working on the capstone!

Presentations
==============

Pitch presentations 
-------------------

Presentation should be about how you can meet the viewer's needs—address those needs from the start.

Code Walkthroughs
------------------

1. The context / structure 
2. The specifics: The code you like the best / how you solved a challenging problem.

Guy Kawasaki's 10-20-30 rule
----------------------------

* 10 slides
* 20 minutes
* 30 pt font (or, max of 30 and age_of_oldest_viewer / 2)



Capstone Project 
================

### [Assemble your crew.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpp5u-I_ZW8)

1. Choose teammates
    * Try to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, skill levels
    * Choose teammates with similar schedules, location
2. Choose an admin, pick a group name
3. Create a basecamp project, invite each other, Al, Jake, client TA

### A suggested workflow

1. Brainstorm desired features
2. Make some crude pencil-and-paper wireframes
3. Divvy up tasks and implement features
4. Review and merge these into the main project
5. GOTO 1 (BREAK once project is complete or the money runs out)

As a general rule, you should try to always have an MVP ('a minimum viable product')—i.e., your website should always be in a functional state at the end of the day, even if it doesn't look like much. Grow your code base incrementally.

### Working together, getting help 

* Spend some time hacking together if possible 
* Communicate with your teammates—keep everyone apprised of potential schedling obstacles as soon as they appear on the horizon. (So they can adjust the workload accordingly)
* Leverage Basecamp, GitHub, Skype, etc.
* Text or email Al, and/or use youcanbook.me to book some time with your TAs—we're all here to help you over any obstacles that arise.
