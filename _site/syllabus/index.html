      <h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>The Primer is Portland Code School’s introduction to web development. It provides you with the starting skills to build modern websites. Whether you’re interested in kickstarting a career in web development or just augmenting your technical skills, the Primer will equip you with hands-on experience working with the web’s core technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as tools indispensable to modern web development: the Unix command line, Git, and GitHub. </p>

<p>The <strong>Basic Primer</strong> is a four-week class that gets you started in the Portland Code School learning environment at low cost. Students spend 6 hours per week in the classroom. It requires 1 hour of homework for every class hour for a total weekly commitment of 12 hours. When you are done, you will be able prepared to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn more about web development</li>
  <li>Create simple websites with HTML &amp; CSS</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Extended Primer</strong> is the Basic Primer plus an additional 4 weeks, building on the Basic Primer to prepare students for the following work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Internship at a web development or creative design studio</li>
  <li>Design and creation of simple websites for small businesses or individuals</li>
  <li>Web development with HTML, CSS and some JavaScript</li>
  <li>Participation in further Portland Code School classes</li>
</ul>

<p>You can take either </p>

<ol>
  <li>the Basic Primer or </li>
  <li>both the Basic and Extended Primer. </li>
</ol>

<p>At this time, we do not offer the Extended Primer as a standalone class.</p>

<h1 id="schedule-and-curriculum">Schedule and Curriculum</h1>

<p>For the most up to date schedule of activities, see the <a href="/course">course curriculum</a>.</p>

<h1 id="educational-expectations">Educational Expectations</h1>

<p>This class is designed to be as gentle an introduction to web development as we can design, while still providing you with industry-standard, professional-level experience.</p>

<p>There are no grades and there is no way you can fail. <em>You</em> get to choose how much effort you put in to the class. If you only have time to come to the Saturday sessions, that’s fine. You’ll still get a lot out of the course. If you have time to do some of the homework, that’s great! Nothing we ask you to do is a waste of your time.</p>

<p>If you are interested in starting a new career in web development, though, we encourage you to do all the assigned work. That way you will get started learning the skills you need, while getting a taste of the level of effort required to be successful in this career path.</p>

<h3 id="student-time-commitment">Student Time Commitment</h3>

<p>Class hours: <strong>Saturday 11a - 5p</strong></p>

<p>You are strongly encouraged to attend all classes, even if you haven’t had time to keep up on the homework. </p>

<p>This course requires 6 hours each week for classroom time. In addition, successful students devote approximately 1 outside hour of their own time each week for each classroom hour for a total of 12 hours per week.</p>

<p>If you just take the Basic Primer, you will need to set aside 4 Saturdays to join us. If you are completing both the Basic and Extended Primer, you will need to devote 8 Saturdays.</p>

<p>Class begins promptly at 11am. Late arrivals and missing team members are very disruptive. If you are going to miss class or even be as little as 10 minutes late, please text Al at 503-970-3645 prior to 11am.</p>

<p>We encourage you to eat an early lunch prior to class. Healthy snacks and drinks are provided and we take lots of short breaks, but there won’t be any long breaks for you to go eat lunch. On graduation celebration days, we’ll cater lunch in house and everybody will have a chance to get to know each other a little better.</p>

<h2 id="assessment-methods">Assessment Methods</h2>

<p>Your progress will be assessed using a variety of methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attendance - You need to show up and do the work</li>
  <li>Completion of assignments - we will keep track of whether you do what we ask you to do</li>
  <li>Code reviews - we will read and assess your code</li>
  <li>Quizzes - we will ask you questions and evaluate your answers</li>
  <li>Instructor reviews - your instructor will observe your work and take notes</li>
  <li>Peer reviews - we’ll talk to everybody in the class to see how folks are doing on teamwork</li>
  <li>Participation in the community - we will ask you to hang out with your peers, meet people, and report back</li>
</ul>

<p>We will provide you feedback as you go. If you go on to take additional PCS classes, your Primer work will become part of your PCS records.</p>

<h1 id="home-and-class-work">Home and Class Work</h1>

<p>You will have plenty of opportunities to learn both in the classroom and on your own. Homework will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Completing class assignments to build web sites of increasing complexity</li>
  <li>Watching screencasts with experienced lecturers, interactive exercises, and quizzes</li>
  <li>Performing online interactive coding exercises to explore HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery</li>
  <li>Participating in a team project to build a pre-specified web site</li>
  <li>Participating in a team project to discover client requirements, specify, and build a web site</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="screencasts">Screencasts</h2>

<p>You will all have <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> accounts assigned to you the week prior to class and you will be assigned screencasts each week. You are required to complete the quizzes and earn the badges. We will review your progress every two weeks to make sure you are on track.</p>

<p>For some of you, screencasts will be a slow experience. Feel free to skip ahead to the quiz for each module to see if you already know what they are teaching. If you have trouble with the quiz, watch the screencasts. Also, speed up the tempo if you can follow along at the faster speed.</p>

<p><strong>Making screencasts a good use of your time</strong></p>

<p>Everybody has different learning styles: some people learn well through screencasts. However, realistically, the density of information is very low. Screencasts can make some subjects more accessible by having a friendly person introduce you, but there is no substitution for reading about topics on your own, studying them in depth, and then applying your knowledge by programming.</p>

<p>As you watch screencasts, some topics will be difficult. Some people have a natural inclination to seek out other textbooks or other screencasts when the one they are watching or reading is difficult to understand. However, this is just a delaying tactic, a form of avoidance. If you are having difficulty learning using one method of learning, the best technique is to use an entirely different method of learning. </p>

<p>In our case, the best alternative when you think you don’t understand how to code is to start coding. Stop the playback and try it yourself. Turn a normally passive activity, watching TV, into an active learning experience by programming while you watch.</p>

<p>There is no better way to learn coding then to do it, to fail, and to puzzle out what is going on. It will be a waste of time for you to switch textbooks or switch screencasts if you find that the offered resources are not giving you immediate understanding.</p>

<h2 id="interactive-programming-exercises">Interactive Programming Exercises.</h2>

<p>You will be required to work through several interactive coding exercises on CodeAcademy (http://www.codecademy.com). These are free of charge.</p>

<h2 id="team-project">Team Project</h2>

<p>After you have had a chance to build a couple of web sites yourself, you’ll have the opportunity to work on a team to build web sites for clients.</p>

<p>The first project (Basic Primer) requires your team to take the specifications for a pre-defined web site and build the site from scratch.</p>

<p>The second project (Extended Primer) requires your team to interview “the client” (PCS staff), develop site specifications, get client approval, and build the site from scratch or use Wordpress to build it, depending on client requirements.</p>

<h2 id="additional-requirements">Additional requirements</h2>

<h3 id="computer">Computer</h3>

<p>You need to provide your own computer for this class. </p>

<p>Portland Code School highly recommends MacBook Pros running OSX 10.9 or later. Most of the best web development tools are developed on that operating system first. The important aspect of OSX is the underlying UNIX-like operating system.  We place an emphasis at being able to work on a Unix/Linux command line level, down in the guts of the operating system.</p>

<p><em>Portland Code School will rent you a MacBook Pro for $25 a month during this course. It’s a great deal.</em></p>

<p>A good alternative is Linux/GNU. Most of your web applications will be deployed on Linux/GNU virtual hosts in the cloud. Any Debian-based distribution will do.</p>

<p>Windows is <em>at best</em> a third alternative. While we will do our best to use cross-platform tools and techniques, you may have to discover Window alternatives on your own.</p>

<p>If you have a Windows laptop and you cannot manage to obtain or rent a MacBook Pro to work with in this class, we can help you a virtual Linux instance that you can use for class activities.  You don’t need an extremely powerful laptop, but we can talk about the minimum specs if you are in this situation.</p>

<p>We’re not saying that professionals should demand a particular tool set. Your instructor is comfortable on any of these platforms and easily moves from one to another as the client requires it. It’s just makes for a more cohesive classroom experience and simpler class materials to simplify and focus on one.</p>

<h3 id="other-tools">Other Tools</h3>
<p>You are required to learn and use <strong>Sublime Text</strong>. (http://www.sublimetext.com) The “stable” version is V2, but Al has been using V3 for a long time and it’s fine. (http://www.sublimetext.com/3)  Sublime Text is not free. You can try it for free and that will get you through this class, but you should consider buying a copy when you get a job.</p>

<p><strong>Git</strong> is a distributed version control system. It is complicated, arcane, and difficult to learn.  Yet, it is one of the most commonly used and essential to any freelancer. We will start using git in the first week and emphasize its use throughout. You will be required to be able to use git from the command line, but we will also explore graphical user interfaces to make your use of git more transparent and powerful.</p>

<p>The <strong>Chrome Developer Tools</strong> are a wonderful suite of browser-based tools that allow you to <em>see</em> what you are coding. There are tools like these for every major browser,  but we focus on Chrome. These are built in to the browser.</p>

<p>There will be more tools introduced as the class goes on, but these are good places to start.</p>

<p>One type of tool we will <em>not</em> use is WYSIWYG (“What you see is what you get”) development environments like Dreamweaver. By the end of this class, you will be easily and quickly coding interesting and compelling web sites “by hand.”</p>

<p>Your first assignment will be to install these tools prior to the first session.</p>

<h1 id="mutual-respect">Mutual Respect</h1>

<p>This class depends upon an atmosphere of mutual respect among students and staff. Together, we create a safe place to listen, learn, speak candidly, and fail safely. This is not a typical college class, it’s a team effort producing a final product: jobs for everyone. You have the opportunity to make deep connections here that you will enjoy the rest of your career. </p>

<p>Students are expected to act at their highest capacity and with mutual respect for each other regardless of age, race, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, or prior experience. Instructors are expected to lead in this regard by example.</p>

<p>In a related vein, this class requires work in close proximity to others as we code and debug in pairs and small groups. Good hygiene is mandatory and an additional sign of respect for your colleagues.</p>

<h2 id="grievances-procedure">Grievances Procedure</h2>

<p>Students who observe or experience any behavior on the part of instructors, staff, or students at Portland Code School that does not meet the school’s Code of Conduct should take action.  If you experience or perceive a problem, attempt to work it out on your own, if possible, but do not hesitate to bring it privately to the attention of your instructor. If this is unsatisfactory, bring it to the attention of the school Director (Cris Kelly) or Assistant Director (Shawna Scott)</p>

<h1 id="instructional-ada-statement">Instructional ADA statement</h1>
<p>Students who have a documented disability and require a classroom adjustment or accommodation should contact the instructor and/or the PCS Director prior to the first class session.</p>

<h1 id="course-content-and-calendar-subject-to-change">Course content and calendar subject to change</h1>

<p>The instructor reserves the right to modify course content and/or substitute assignments and learning activities in response to institutional, weather or class situations.</p>

<p>We adjust the class each session to the needs of the current students. We may slow the pace or add additional work, as needed. We also carefully incorporate new technologies as they become significant to your employability. As a result, we often are creating class materials as we go. You will always get advance notice of classwork.</p>

<p>You also get to evaluate <em>us</em>. We use a technique called “project retrospectives” to identify what’s working for you and what we need to improve. We try to improve the course as we go.</p>
