This class is an introduction to iOS development. It introduces Objective-C, still the most-commonly used language in iOS applications, and explores the various services and techniques used by iOS developers.

*Why not Swift?*

Our employer partners tell us that most of the apps on the market now are written in Objective-C, so new developers need to have a good command of this language in order to get a job. As Swift becomes more wide-spread, we'll add more Swift to the class. However, all the services and technniques we use apply to both languages.
